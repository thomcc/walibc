# `walibc`: A libc for "bare metal wasm" targets.

The goal of this library is to allow Rust code that targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (for example) to be able to use Rust crates that bundle C libraries. These targets are effectively bare-metal, and don't come with their own C library, even things like `memcpy` are unavailable (because `string.h` doesn't exist). Unfortunately, they're also widely used, as they don't require installing a separate SDK (such as the WASI SDK, or the Emscripten SDK). `walibc` exists to fill that gap.

This wouldn't be seamless (the C library bundler would have to add a build dep on `walibc`), but it would allow things like (for example) libsqlite3-sys to avoid the need to carry it's own implementation of libc functions.

Currently, it's essentially a nearly-header-only subset-of-libc; almost everything is defined as `static inline`. There aren't an abundance of good reasons for it being header only, but the basic one is it lets us avoid linker issues if two distinct copies of `walibc` are used in a single build with no coordination. There are a few other workflow-related reasons too -- this better avoids symbol collisions in some cases.

And not for nothing, making most functions inline goes part of the way towards addressing how na√Øve many of our function implementations are.

## Non-goals
- Supporting non-Clang compilers.
- Supporting non-wasm targets.
- Supporting non-Rust use, for now.

## License
MIT. While most of `walibc` was written fresh, portions are taken from other places, all of which are either public domain, or MIT licensed themselves:

- Portions of `walibc` were ported from [pdclib](https://github.com/DevSolar/pdclib), which is public domain.
- The implementation of the `vsnprintf`-family of functions is taken from [`stb_sprintf`](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/013ac3beddff3dbffafd5177e7972067cd2b5083/stb_sprintf.h) (with some modifications), which is public also domain.
- Portions of `walibc` are based on code from [musl](https://musl.libc.org/), which is also [MIT licensed](https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/COPYRIGHT?h=v1.2.5).
